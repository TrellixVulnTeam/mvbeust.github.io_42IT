# Old Personal Website

This is the code of my old personal website that was hosted on Github. I moved it to firebase.  

---

The website was mainly built on a javascript frontend which had the disadvantage of very slow load times.  
Every part of the website was fully optimized for responsive usage and use a customized version of materializecss for the design and interaction.
